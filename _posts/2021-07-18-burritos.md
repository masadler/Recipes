    1. Cook the rice in the vegetable stock until it is cooked. Whole grain rice usually takes 45 minutes to cook, plus an additional 15 minutes of soakening with the heat turned off. Chop the dried tomates into small pieces and add them to the cooked rice, together with the lemon juice. Season with pepper and salt if not salty enough from the vegetable stock.
    2. In the mean time prepare the bean mixture. Heat up some olive oil in a pan, add the chopped onion and fry it. Then, add the finely chopped (or pressed) garlic together with the Cayenne pepper, chili flakes and cumin and fry the spices for a few minutes.
    3. Wash the beans, drain the mais and add them to the pan. Let everything cook for roughly 10 minutes and season with salt and pepper. If the mixture is too dry during cooking (risk of burning) add some water to it.
    4. Prepare the guacamole by peeling the avocados and mashing them with a fork. Add the lemon juice and taste with salt and pepper. If you like it spicy, you can also add some paprika spice or Cayenne pepper to it.
    5. Lastly, prepare the cream sauce. Finely chop the garlic (or better press it) and add it to the soy sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Ideally, you prepare this sauce at least 1 hour in advance so that the garlic has the time to diffuse into the sauce. 
    6. Heat up the tortillas according to the package instructions.
    7. Assemble your burrito with the rice, bean mixture, guacamole, cream sauce and lettuce, and enjoy!

    - <sup>*</sup>Any other rice is fine as well, e.g. Basmati rice.
    - Vegan chicken stripes (such as [planted chicken](https://en.eatplanted.com)) can also be added for a more meaty-like experience!
