    1. Soak the soya mince in boiling vegetable stock (concentrated) according to the package instructions. When using the one from Alnatura, 400 mL of water is enough and the soaking time is 15 minutes. After the soaking, drain the minced soya.
    2. In the mean time, heat up the olive oil in a big pot and fry the chopped onion. Towards the end of the frying time add the finely chopped or pressed garlic. 
    3. Add the minced soya and let it fry until the remaining water evaporates and it becomes slightly crispy. 
    4. Peel the carrots and celery root, cut them into very fine cubes, and add them to the pot. Chop the bell pepper and mushrooms in small pieces as well and add them to the mixture. Let everything fry for a few minutes.
    5. Then add the tomato sauce, rinse the glass with 100-150ml of water and add it as well. Don't add too much water, otherwise the sauce becomes to watery. Even if it feels rather thick at the becoming, be aware that the vegetables release more water during cooking.
    6. Let the sauce cook for 1h-3h. The longer the cooking time, the more tasty the sauce.
    7. At the end, add the spices.
    8. In a separate pot prepare the Béchamel sauce. Melt the margarine at low temperatures, add the flour and whip everything into a homogeneous paste.
    9. Then add the milk and turn up the temperature to maximal heat until the milk boils. Continuously stir until it thickens, and then take it away from the heat. Add the spices. A lot of salt/vegetable stock spices might be necessary for the sauce to become tasty.
    10. Layer the lasagne by first starting with the bolognese sauce. Then, continue with a layer of sheets, followed by a good third of the Béchamel sauce, some grated cheese and half the parmesan. Cover the Béchamel sauce layer with sheets, add tomato sauce, sheets and another Béchamel-cheese layer covered again by sheets. 
    11. On the last layer, add the remaining tomato sauce, Béchamel sauce and cover generously with grated cheese.
    12. Cook the lasagne in the oven at 180°C for 45 minutes.
