    1. Cook the rice in the vegetable stock until it is cooked. Whole grain rice usually takes 45 minutes to cook, plus an additional 15 minutes of soakening with the heat turned off.
    2. In a pan, heat up the rice vinegar, salt and sugar at medium heat until a homogenous liquid is obtained. Pour it over the cooked rice, mix and let the rice cool down.
    3. In the mean time prepare the tofu marinade. Finely chop the onion, garlic and ginger (the latter two can also be pressed) and mix with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sambal oelek and sesame oil.
    4. Chop the tofu into cubes and mix with the marinade. The tofu mixture can either be eaten raw or cooked after being fried in a pan.
    5. Prepare the toppings by cutting the mango, avocado and cucumber into cubes.
    6. Mix all the ingredients for the sauce in a blender until smooth.
    7. Assemble your poke bowl by first adding the rice and arranging the toppings and tofu on top.

    - <sup>*</sup>Sushi rice would be more authentic, but other rice types work as well.
