    1. **Prepare the dry base**: Blend the oats into a fine flour. In a large bowl, mix the oat flour, spelt flours, salt, cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla.
    2. **Add the yoghurt**: Stir the yoghurt into the dry mixture until well combined.
    3. **Prepare the wet mix**: Melt the coconut oil (microwave or stovetop). Mix in the maple syrup. If using linseeds, prepare a linseed egg by mixing 3 tbsp ground linseeds with 9 tbsp water. Let soak for 10 minutes.
    4. **Prepare the fruit**: Wash, peel and finely chop the apples, wash the blueberries, and cut the dates into small pieces.
    5. **Combine everything**: Mix the wet ingredients into the yoghurt-flour mixture, then fold in the fruit. Stir until evenly distributed.
    6. **Form the dough balls**: Shape dough into balls using approx. 2 tbsp per piece (~100 g). You should get around 20 dough balls. If using the glaze, brush the tops with the maple-soy glaze mixture.
    7. **Bake**: Preheat the oven to 170 °C. Bake the dough balls on a lined tray for about 45 minutes, until golden and set. EnEnjoy them freshly baked, or freeze for later — perfect as a convenient, wholesome snack.

  notes_markdown: |-

    - <sup>(1)</sup> You can adjust the flour mixture to your preference. For a gluten-free version, use only oat flour. For a lighter texture, use only white flour.
    - <sup>(2)</sup> Fruity yoghurt alternatives (with added sugars) will naturally sweeten the dough.
    - <sup>(3)</sup> For a non-vegan version, you can also use curd cheese (de: Quark). More yoghurt or curd cheese will make the balls fluffier.
    - This is a mildly sweet recipe. Adjust sweetness to taste by increasing maple syrup or dates. You can also use just one sweetener (e.g. 200 g dates only).
