    1. Chop the vegetables: Finely chop the onion, finely mince the garlic (or crush with a garlic press), cut the tomatoes into dices, the bell pepper into thin slices and chop the artichoke hearts.
    2. Heat up 3 tbsp of olive oil in a large pan or paella pan. Do not use a wok as the rice will not cook evenly. Fry the onion for 2 minutes, then add the garlic, salt and pepper. Fry for another minute. 
    3. Add the remaining spices and fry for 30-60 seconds. 
    4. Add the tomatoes and bell pepper slices, maybe leaving some aside for garnish. Cook for 5 minutes until the bell peppers start to soften. Stir regularly.
    5. Add the rice, toasting it for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    6. Dissolve the bouillon cubes in the boiling water. Cover the rice in the liquid and add the saffron. Bring to a boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered for 20-30 minutes (40 minutes if risotto rice) until the rice is tender. Avoid stirring the rice while it cooks as this will make it sticky.
    7. When the liquid has been absorbed by the rice test if it is cooked by trying the rice on the outer-most part of the pan. If the rice is firm, but tender, it is ready. Otherwise add some more water and continue cooking until tender.
    8. When the rice is about to be tender, add the peas and half the artichokes. Gently stir in and add the remaining artichokes on top, along with the reserved bell pepper slices.
    9. Remove the pan from the heat, cover with a lid, and let the paella rest for 10 minutes. Serve with lemon slices.

  notes_markdown: |-
    
    - <sup>(1)</sup>if not available, risotto rice works as well, although the paella will become more sticky and more risotto-like. 
    - <sup>(2)</sup>1-2 tbsp of vegetable stock powder work as well.
