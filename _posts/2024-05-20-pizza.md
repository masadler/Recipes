    1.**Prepare the zucchini topping**: Cut the zucchini into 1 cm thick and 5 cm long slices. Heat up olive oil in a pan and fry the zucchini slices on both sides. They should turn slightly brown on both sides. Optionally, season with oregano and paprika spice.
    2. **Prepare the aubergine topping**: Cut the aubergines into 1 cm thick slices. Carve the aubergines crosswise with a knife (see picture) without cutting through. Prepare an oil marinade by mixing 3 tbsp of olive oil, 1/2 tbsp of oregano, 1 tsp of paprika spice and 1/2 tsp of salt. Brush the slices with the marinade and set aside.
    3. **Prepare the mushroom topping**: Cut the mushrooms into slices. Peel the onion and cut into small dices. Heat up olive oil in a pan. First fry the onion and then add the mushrooms. Fry until most of the water has evaporated. Season with pepper.
    4. **Prepare the spinach topping**: Heat up olive oil in a pan (or reuse the pan from the zucchini frying) and fry the pressed or finely minced garlic clove for less than a minute (it should not turn brown). Add the spinach and cook for a few minutes until it is cooked.
    5. **Prepare the pizza**: Roll out the dough on a tray, spread the tomato sauce and season with oregano. Spread the toppings and optionally cover with mozarella or vegan cheese. The pizza can also be left without cheese since the vegetables are roasted and/or covered in oil. For a goat cheese topping, leave one part of the pizza empty.
    6. **Bake the pizza**: Bake the pizza in the preheated oven according to the dough packaging instructions. It should be around 240°C for an oven with top and bottom heating and 220°C for a convection oven. For the goat cheese option, cut the goat cheese into slices and add it to the pizza after 10 minutes of baking. After the pizza turns golden, take it out and optionally serve with rucola.
