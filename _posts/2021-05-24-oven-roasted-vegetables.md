    2. Wash the potatoes and sweet potatoes and cut them into wedges (leave the skin on). Put them into a big pot.

    5. Add the olive oil and spices and mix everything.
    6. Lay out two baking trays with baking paper and distribute the mixture on them. 
    7. Let it cook in the oven for 45 minutes and enjoy!
