    1. Preheat the oven to 180 Â°C.
    2. Wash the potatoes and sweet potatoes and cut them into wedges (leave the skin on). Put them into a big pot.
    3. Cut the zucchini and aubergine into eatable chunks and add them to the mixture. Cut the onion into big rings and add it as well.
    4. Peel the garlic cloves. Chop two of them into small pieces (or use a garlic press) and if you like garlic, add the other cloves to the mixture as a whole.
    5. Add the olive oil and spices and mix everything.
    6. Lay out two baking trays with baking paper and distribute the mixture on them. 
    7. Let it cook in the oven for 45 minutes and enjoy!

    - Hokkaido pumpkin is also a great vegetable to be added to the plate. In this case, leave out the sweet potatoes to avoid having to many sweet vegetables in the mixture.
    - Tofu-sausages fit very well to this dish!

Oven roasted vegetables are simple to prepare and a good way to use up left-over vegetables. Enjoy alone or with some dips such as hummus.
