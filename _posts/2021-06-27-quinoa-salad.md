    1. Cook the quinoa in vegetable stock or salted water according to the instructions on the package (usually it takes 15 minutes). Afterwards drain it for some time and let it cool down. If not drained properly, the salad will become very watery. For the same reason, also do not overcook the quinoa.
    2. Open the pomegranate and add the seeds to a big salad bowl.
    3. Cut the cherry tomatoes into half, chop the avocado into eatable pieces, and add together with the finely chopped bell pepper, drained mais and cranberries to the mixture.
    4. Chop the white of the spring onions into very fine pieces, and the green leaves into rings and add as well. 
    5. In a separate bowl, thoroughly mix the ingredients of the salad sauce, and add together with the quinoa to the rest. 
    6. Mix the salad and let it diffuse for 1-4 hours in the fridge before eating.

    - <sup>*</sup>This is optional, but adds a great fruity flavour. Alternatively, use orange vinegar.
    - Feta cheese fits nicely into the salad as well!

Quinoa salad is a great summer dish (but not only)! Either eat alone or as a side-dish, for instance with other salads such as pasta or potato salad, and meat alternatives.
