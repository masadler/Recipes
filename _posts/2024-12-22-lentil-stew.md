    * 2 garlic cloves
    * 1 leek
    * 1/2 celery root (~200 g)
    * 2-3 carrots (~200–300 g)
    * ~200 g potatoes
    * 200 g green lentils

    1. **Prepare the vegetables**: Peel the carrots, celery, and potatoes. Cut all vegetables into small cubes. Clean and slice the leek. Finely chop the onion and crush or finely chop the garlic.
    2. **Sauté the base**: Heat 2–3 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and fry for about 5 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and sliced leek, and sauté for another 5 minutes.
    3. **Add root vegetables**: Stir in the chopped carrots, celeriac, and potatoes. Fry everything for about 2 more minutes, stirring occasionally.
    4. **Add lentils and broth**: Add the green lentils to the pot, then pour in enough water to cover everything. Stir in the bouillon.
    4. **Simmer and season**: Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the vegetables and lentils are tender. Add chopped parsley, thyme, oregano, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
    5. **Finish**: Optionally, use a hand blender to puree part or all of the soup for a creamier consistency — or leave it chunky for a more rustic feel.

    - Croutons go well with this soup. Simply toss bread cubes with olive oil and herbs (such as oregano and thyme), then either pan-fry them or bake them in the oven until crispy.
