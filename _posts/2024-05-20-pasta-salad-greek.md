    1. Cook the pasta in salt water. Rather cook them al dente as they will absorb more liquid from the salad sauce. After cooking, rinse the pasta with cold water, as this will prevent it from becoming sticky.
    2. Half the cherry tomatoes, peel and cut the cucumber into dices, half the black olives and cut the feta into dices. Finely chop the herbs.
    3. In a salad bowl, thoroughly mix the ingredients of the salad sauce. Then, add the pasta and mix it with the sauce. Next, add all the other ingredients.
    6. Mix the salad and let it diffuse for 1-4 hours in the fridge before eating.
