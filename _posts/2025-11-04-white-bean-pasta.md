  ingredients_markdown: |-

    * 250 g fettucine pasta
    * 3 cloves garlic
    * 2 tbsp olive oil
    * 1 tsbp margarine
    * ~400 g cherry tomatoes
    * 100 g baby spinach
    * 1 can of canellini beans (around 250 g drained weight)

  directions_markdown: |-

    1. **Prepare the vegetables**: Peel and mince the garlic, or press it with a garlic press. Wash the tomatoes and optionally cut them in half. Rinse and drain the spinach leaves.
    2. **Cook the pasta**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until *al dente* according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
    3. **Prepare the sauce**: Heat the olive oil and margarine in a large pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1–2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, basil, about 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and about 10 grinds of black pepper. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften and release their juices. Make sure the pan isn’t too hot so the garlic doesn’t burn. Once the tomatoes begin to break down, stir in the spinach and cook until just softened.
    4. **Finish the dish**: Rinse and drain the beans, then add them to the pan. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or herbs if needed. Add the drained pasta and mix everything together until evenly combined and heated through.
    5. **Serve**: Divide the pasta among plates and optionally top with freshly grated Parmesan or a plant-based alternative. Serve immediately.
