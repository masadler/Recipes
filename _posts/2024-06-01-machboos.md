    1. Mix the chicken with 1 tbsp of olive oil and marinate with the chicken spices. Heat up 1 tbsp of olive oil in a pan and fry the chicken until it becomes crispy.
    2. Soak the basmati rice in cold water for at least 15 minutes, then rinse and drain it.
    3. Heat up 3 tbsp of olive oil in a big pot and fry the onions for about 10 minutes until they start to become brown. Add the garlic, chili pepper and ginger and saut√© for another 2 minutes.
    4. Add the turmeric, za'atar, coriander, cumin, paprika, nutmeg, cloves and cook for another minute. Now add the fried chicken to the pot, along with the tomatoes, lime slices, cardamom pods, cinnamon, ground cloves and salt.
    5. Add the drained rice, parsley and cilantro to the mixture, cover with hot vegetable stock and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes until the rice is cooked. Add more water if needed. The dish is now ready to be served, optionally with green salad and [cucumber raita](https://biancazapatka.com/en/vegan-raita-recipe/).

  notes_markdown: |-
    
    - <sup>(1)</sup>I use [planted chicken](https://ch.eatplanted.com/products/planted-chicken-natur).
    - <sup>(2)</sup>Take out the seeds, otherwise it will likely become too spicy.
    - <sup>(3)</sup>The original recipe calls for baharat instead of za'atar. Have a look at the link below.
