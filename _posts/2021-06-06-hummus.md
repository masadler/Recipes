  notes_markdown: |-
  
    - <sup>*</sup>Depending on the consistency of your mixture, you might want to add more or less water to obtain a creamy texture that is not too liquid. To be on the safe side, rather add less water in the beginning, and continue adding while blending the mixture.
    - In a sealed box, hummus can be preserved in the fridge for at least 5 days.
    - Instead of using a stick blender, you can also use a smoothie mixer to puree the chickpeas.

Hummus is a very versatile food, rich in proteins and iron! It can be either eaten as a dip together with fresh carrots, cherry tomatoes, celery, cauliflower, etc., as a paste on bread or sandwich (add dried tomatoes preserved in oil for extra flavour on top of your sandwich!), as a sauce to roasted potatoes or vegetables, or together with falafals!
