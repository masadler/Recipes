    1. **Egg preparation** (*for a vegan version leave this step out*): Cook the egg in boiling water for 6 minutes (**6 minutes** for room temperature eggs and or **7 minutes** for fridge cold eggs). You can add 1 Tbsp of vinegar to the water for easier peeling. After cooking, cool the eggs with cold water and gently peel them. In the meantime prepare the marinade in a ziplock plastic bag that you put in a bowl for stabilization. Add the water, soy sauce, and mirin to the bag and gently place the eggs inside. Squeeze the air out of the bag to ensure the eggs are covered in the marinade and close the bag with a clip. The eggs should be marinated in the fridge for at least two hours, but can be kept for up to 3-4 days.
    2. **Vegetable preparation**: Peel the garlic cloves and cut them into slices. Peel the ginger and cut it into fine strips. Cut the white of the spring onions into small pieces and green in rings. Put the green rings aside. Peel the carrots and cut them into Julienne strips. Take out the stem and cut the brown mushrooms into quarters or slices. Slice the cabbage or pak choi. Drain the mais.
    3. **Soup preparation**: Heat up the sesame oil in a pot. Add the garlic, ginger and the white of the spring onions and fry for 2-3 minutes. Add 2 Tbsp of soy sauce and fry for 2 more minutes. Add the mushrooms and carrots and fry for another 2 minutes. Cover the vegetables with 1.5 L of vegetable stock and add the shiitake mushrooms and miso paste. Let the broth cook for 5-10 minutes. Towards the end of the cooking time add the green of the spring onions (leave some out for serving), the mais, and the pak choi/cabbage and let the soup cook for 2 more minutes.
    4. **Tofu preparation**: In the meantime, cut the tofu into slices and fry them with in an airfryer or with some sesame oil in a pan. Optionally, prior frying marinate the tofu with corn starch.
    5. **Noodle preparation**: Cook the ramen/udon noodles according to the packaging instructions in a separate pot. If all the soup is eaten at once, the noodles can also be added directly to the broth. However, be careful as the noodles become soggy very quickly.
    6. **Arrange the ramen bowl**: Add the broth with the vegetables to bowl or soup plates and add the noodles. Take the eggs out of the fridge, half them and decorative put them on top of the soup. Add the fried tofu slices. Optionally, spicy the soup with chili oil and add 1-2 Tbsp of soy sauce to each serving for more flavour.
