   * 1 kg potatoes, (starchy, de: mehligkochend)
   * 300 g carrots<sup>(1)</sup>
   * 4 garlic cloves
   * 200 g green lentils<sup>(2)</sup>
   * 50 g margarine

  directions_markdown: |-

    1. Peel the potatoes, carrots, and garlic. Cook them together in salted water for about 25 minutes, until the carrots are tender.
    2. Meanwhile, rinse the lentils and cook them in salted water for about 25 minutes, until soft.
    3. Add margarine to the cooked vegetables and mash with a potato masher, leaving some chunks if desired. Stir in soy milk gradually until the mixture reaches a creamy consistency. Season with nutmeg, salt, pepper, and optionally parsley.
    4. Layer the mixtures in an ovenproof dish: First, half the mashed potato mixture, then half the corn, next all the lentils, a layer of cheese, the remaining corn, the rest of the potato-vegetable mash and finally top with cheese. Depending on your dish size, you might prefer three layers of mash and two of lentils.
    5. Bake in a preheated oven at 200 °C for 20–30 minutes, or until nicely crisped on top.

  notes_markdown: |-

    - <sup>(1)</sup> More carrots will make it slightly sweeter.
    - <sup>(2)</sup> Use fewer lentils for a less lentil-heavy version.
    - <sup>(3)</sup> Any type of milk works.
    - <sup>(4)</sup> Use dairy-free cheese for a vegan option.
