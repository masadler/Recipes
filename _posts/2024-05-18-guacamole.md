    1. Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit, and scoop them into a bowl. Mash them with a fork.
    2. Add the lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Your guacamole, basic version, is ready to be served.
    3. For a more savoury version, crush the garlic clove in a garlic press (or chop it very finely), finely chop the cilantro, finely dice the jalapeno pepper and cut the tomatoes into dices. Add all the ingredients to the bowl and mix. Season with cumin, salt, pepper and lime to your likening.

    - <sup>*</sup>Instead of half a lime, you can also use 1 tbsp of lemon juice. Better to use fresh limes or lemons than lime juice from a bottle.
    - Guacamole can serve as a dip with tortilla chips, vegetables such as carrots, peppers and sellerie, be used as a spread for avocado toast or serve as a sauce for burritos, and all sorts of salads (pasta, quinoa).
    - Guacamole is best stored in an air-tight container to avoid it from turning brown.
