    1. **Cook the lentils**: Rinse the lentils and cook them in salted water for 20–25 minutes until tender but not mushy. Drain very well and let cool slightly.
    2. **Prepare the vegetables & base**: Chop the onions. Peel and grate or press the garlic. Peel and roughly chop the carrots, then pulse in a blender until finely shredded. Chop the parsley. Prepare the linseed egg by mixing 3 tbsp ground linseeds with 9 tbsp water. Let sit for 10 minutes to gel. Blend the oats into a coarse flour using the blender.
    3. **Sauté the vegetables**: In a large pan, heat 4 tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté for 5–10 minutes until translucent. Add garlic and cook for another 1–2 minutes. Add the shredded carrots and cook for 5 more minutes.
    4. **Combine the burger mix**: In a large bowl, mash the lentils with a fork or potato masher until coarsely mashed. Add the linseed egg, sautéed vegetables, chopped parsley, tomato paste, spices, and half of the ground oats. Mix thoroughly. Gradually add more oats until the mixture holds together well. Adjust salt and pepper to taste.
    5. **Shape the patties**: Form burger patties with your hands, using approx. 100–120 g per patty which should get you about 16 patties. Let rest and dry for 1 hour (optional, but useful if the mixture is wetter).
    6. **Bake the patties**: Preheat the oven to 180 °C. Place patties on a lined baking tray, brush lightly with sunflower or rapeseed oil, and bake for 15 minutes. Flip, brush again with oil, and bake for another 10 minutes.
    7. **Serve or store**: Serve immediately, or allow to cool and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Reheat in the oven, microwave, or pan-fry in oil for best texture.
