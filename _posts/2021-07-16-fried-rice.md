    1. Cook the rice in vegetable stock.
    2. Then in a large pan/wok, heat up the sesame oil.
    3. Chop the white part of the spring onion into pieces and fry them in the oil. Cut as well the green leaves of the onion and keep them for the frying/serving part later on.
    4. Cut the carrots and zucchini into Julienne strips and add them to the pan. Let them fry for a few minutes and then add the mushrooms, also cut into fine strips. 
    5. Let everything fry until the vegetables are cooked and maybe cover the pan with a lid. Towards the end of the cooking time add the peas.
    6. In the mean time, chop the tofu into small cubes and fry it in a bit of sesame oil in a separate pan.
    7. Once the rice, vegetables and tofu are ready, it's time to fry the mixture. Either use an additional pan, or transfer the vegetables to a temporary bowl to liberate the pan. Make sure the rice is not to watery, otherwise it won't fry very well.
    8. Then heat up some sesame oil in the pan and add the rice, vegetables and tofu. If your pan is not big enough, only add half of everything. Add the soy sauce, a pinch of cayenne pepper, normal pepper and the green part of the spring onions. If not salty enough, add some more salt as well. Let the whole mixture fry until the rice becomes slightly crispy and enjoy!

    - To gain time, instead of using fresh vegetables, use a mix of frozen (Asian) vegetables.
