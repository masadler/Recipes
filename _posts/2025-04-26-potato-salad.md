    1. Cook the potatoes (with skin) in salted water until just tender, drain, and peel while hot. Cut into slices about 5 mm thick and place in a large bowl. Set aside roughly 100 g of the slices for the sauce.
    2. Roughly chop the onion. In a blender or food processor, combine the onion with mustard, vinegar, oil, hot vegetable stock, and the 100 g of set-aside potatoes. Blend until smooth and season with salt and pepper.
    3. Pour the sauce over the warm sliced potatoes, mix gently, and cover. Let the salad sit for about 30 minutes at room temperature to allow the flavors to infuse.
    4. Peel the cucumber, halve it lengthwise, remove seeds, and slice into thin (~3 mm) pieces. Finely chop the chives.
    5. Add the cucumber and chives to the salad and gently combine everything. Serve chilled or at room temperature.
